What is?

The Collatz Conjecture is a famous unsolved mathematical problem named after Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937. It begins with an initial positive integer and applies the following rules repeatedly:
    1. If the current number is even, divide it by 2.
    2. If the current number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
The conjecture posits that, regardless of the initial positive integer chosen, this process will eventually reach 1 and continue in an endless loop of 4, 2, 1.
